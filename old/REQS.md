# JS-Calendar

Tiny task to have some every day problems to solve and get your hands dirty with real world problems...

* implement a web calendar with a grid layout
* the calendar should show a real month
* Week starts with Mondays and stops on Sundays
* fill in the beginning and the end of the month with days from last/next month
* implement a dropdown to select year and month
* implement a forward/backward button next to it
* develop on feature/* branches and commit on a regular basis
* Do not use any big framework for now. We will come to that later. Helper libs are allowed, let's discuss it if you want to use any.
